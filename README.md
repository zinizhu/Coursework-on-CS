# Coursework-on-CS
Thank you for your attention!
This repository contains either completed projects I have done in class or just some pieces of codes I've written for the convenience of my homework.
They are the starting point of my journey to the CS world.
All the work is done by myself.
These codes may not look beautiful right now, but as long as I learn more I will make them more professional.
